                                                 *****Jenkins Agents*****

Jenkins Agents are used to run jenkins builds,jobs or workload on nodes other than the built-in node or master node.
They are referred as Jenkins slave nodes or agents.

There are serveral methods to configure these agents on Jenkins.

1. Cloud Agents (Using Docker Cloud)
2. Docker Containers (As permanent nodes)
3. Remote machines (Nodes other than the master node)
4. Kubernetes (Jenkins builds can run as pods)



     *****Cloud Agents (Using Docker Cloud)*****

--Open Jenkins
     Manage Jenkins > Clouds > New cloud (Select Docker and give a name)
          > Docker cloud details
               Set Docker Host URI: unix:///var/run/docker.sock              (When docker and jenkins are running on the same machine)
                                 or tcp://0.0.0.0:2375                       (When jenkins needs to connect to docker daemon on another machine)
               Check mark Enabled and Expose Docker_Host option

          > Docker Agent Templates
               Labels: docker-agent-alpine                                   (Very important to label agent properly, jenkins will use this label to search agents)
               Docker image: jenkins/agent:latest-jdk11                      (Image should have java pre-installed for -attach docker container method)
               Instance capacity: 2                                          (Simultaneous instances)
               Remote File System Root: /home/jenkins/cloudagent             (Can be anything)

     Leave the rest to default and save the agent settings.

--Now to use this Docker cloud agent, Use label for you agent in the Jenkinsfile:
          agent {
            docker {
                label 'docker-agent-alpine'
            }
          }
